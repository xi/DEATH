Welcome to DEATH !
DEATH is a variant to Conways game of LIFE.

Every LIFE game can be described by two sets of numbers:
* numbers of neighbors for a item to survive
* numbers of neighbors for a item to be born

What I added is mulitiplayer support and a third number:
* numbers of friendly neighbors for a friendly item to survive
* numbers of friendly neighbors for a friendly item to be born
* numbers of friendly neighbors for a foe item to be killed
the players take turns.

CONTROLS:
arrow-keys - move cursor
space      - toggle field value
               after that it is the next players' turn
backspace  - clear field value
return     - perform a full step (one for every player)
tab        - perform a single step (only for the active player)
               after that it is the next players' turn
h          - display a help screen
escape     - quit
